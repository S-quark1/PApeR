        <h1>History of paper</h1>
        <h5>&#8544;. First paper and origin</h5>
        <p>&bull; Many centuries ago people in Egypt made a kind of paper from the papyrus plant.
          This is where the word 'paper' comes from. The people of Greece and Rome learned to
          do this too. The Romans wrote on parchment (made from animal skin), on waxed
          tablets and on wood. <br>
          &bull; Before 105 AD chinese people used bamboo and silk. Then they made a <span class="hoverme" id="incorrect">paPeR</span> from cotton rags,
          hemp, various plant fibres and old fish nets. The oldest existing paper with writing on
          it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the Great Wall of China.</p>
        <h5>II. Further spreading</h5>
        <p>&bull; People in Japan learned how to make paper with fibres of the mulberry tree, around 610 AD.
          This is called Japanese paper or Washi. The Chinese invention spread to India, and then to the Middle East, and then to Italy.<br>
          &bull; After The Battle of Talas in 751 the Arab army captured soldiers of the Chinese and there were <span class="hoverme" id="incor">PapeR</span> makers.
          From them, paper-making spread throughout the Islamic world. <br>
          &bull; In 757, a <span class="hoverme" id="rid">PAPER</span> mill was built at Samarkand. People learned to use linen as paper raw material
          and to use starch made from flour as an additive. <br>
          &bull; In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at Fabriano and, until the 14 century,
          Italy was a paper supplier in Europe.</p>
        <h5>III. Paper in 19th century</h5>
        <p>&bull; Paper was hard to make and expensive. A mechanical <span class="hoverme" id="wrongee">pAPer</span> maker was conceived in France
          1798, which made the process cheaper but the raw material was still expensive. <br>
          &bull; In 1840 Friedrich Gottlob Keller Invented a machine that could make paper out of wood fibres.
          <span class="hoverme" id="wrong">papEr</span> became cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other inventions like the pencil, the fountain pen, and a
          printing press were made. Now, people wrote more letters, made more books and newspapers. <br>
          </p>
        <h5>IV. Nowadays</h5>
        <p>&bull; Paper is used for writing and printing. Books, magazines and newspapers are printed on paper. Even though lots of
        information nowadays is stored in digital form, paper is still important in our everyday life</p>
