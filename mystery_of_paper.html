        <h1>Mystery of paper</h1>
        <h5>&#8545;. The Legends of origami #1</h5>
        <p>&bull; A long time on the ground there lived a poor master who dedicated his entire life origami.
          He was very kind to everyone and everything that surrounded him. His main occupation was the
          folding of sheets of different figures from <span class="hoverme" id="incorrect">Paper</span>, which he handed out to children. <br>
          &bull; One day he met on the road traveling monk and gave him a figure of crane. It touched a monk, and he said:
          "put their figures on. The main thing - your belief in their importance. Even if the war
          around, stay true to his art, and it will thank you by making the rich and famous."<br>
          &bull; After some time, in fact, the war broke out. Young went on to fight this long and bloody war.
          And poor Master stubbornly continued to collect their figures which annoyed people around.
          Angered, the neighbors decided to burn his house, but once there, they were delighted with
          the variety and magnificence of the figures. Good master gave each one included in his house
          people liked figure. In front of the guests the master made a crane from <span class="hoverme" id="incor">pAper</span>, which came to
          life in his hands and flew away - he was a messenger of peace. People were
          inspired by and soon the victory was for them.<br>
          &bull; After the Second World War, Crane became a symbol of peace and freedom.
          And also a symbol of deliverance from the threat of nuclear and radiation sickness.</p>
        <h5>&#8545;. The Legends of origami #2</h5>
        <p>&bull; Another ancient legend said that origami store a part of the soul of the person
          who made it. People believed that adding the figures, a person invests in them a part
          of himself. They say that once a rich man rewarded, having presented him a great origamy ball. <br>
          &bull; But the rich man could not find his place in his home and gave his old mother, who lived nearby.
          Once her son got sick, but evil sister in law is not allowed to visit his mother. After his death,
          when his mother spoke about what had happened, she was already all knew, because the moment of death
          of her son, a ball, which he gave to her, fell and crumbled to pieces.</p>
